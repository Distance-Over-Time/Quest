        Oak: <sub>A customer.</sub>
        Ash: <sub>CUSTOMER.</sub>
        Oak: Welcome paying patron to our humble establishment~
        Oak: We invite you to peruse our menu of spirits, nightcaps, and libations, all made by fairy hands... 
        Ash: HOW CANS WE SERVES YOU TODAY?
        Oak: Perhaps a thimble of morning dew?
        Ash: JUICY, DELICIOUS BLACKBERRY CORDIAL?
        Oak: Flax into Gold perhaps or an elfshot of--
        Ash: HONEYWINE?
        Oak: Ash, my good fellow, we are out of honeywine.
        Ash: THE BEES.
        Oak: Yes, they do not slumber yet. We must pay the great dragon a visit.

        <<if $gaveKeyItem0 is true>>
            Oak: Although, the trees rustle with whispers--I believe we will have honey again for our stores soon.
            Ash: YES. YESSSSS.
        <<endif>>

        Oak: So we ask again, visitor from afar, how might we two quench your thirst?
        -> I'm looking for some golden grog.
            Ash: GROG?! NASTY.
            Oak: It is an affront to our skills.
            Oak: Although, my dearest Ash, we do not turn away customers without taste.
            Ash: <sub>BLECH.</sub>
            Oak: Perhaps if we let them taste the golden ichor, unfiltered....
            Ash: THEY WILL LEARN! YES!
            Oak: Indeed. We will elevate your palette valued patron.
            Oak: Though, we do not do any work for free.
            
        -> I've been told of a golden drink, said to be the finest in this land...?
            Ash: PRETTY WORDS.
            Oak: Though not an exaggeration. Our honeywine draws many souls to these woods.
            Oak: If that is what you seek, like so many at our door, ingredient stock aside, we must emphasize that we do not do any work for free.

            Ash: THE GOLD. I DO NOT SMELL IT.
            Oak: Nor have I heard its clink on your person.
            Oak: But your hands speak of familiarity with creation, dear patron.
            Oak: And we do love a good barter. Might we offer a trade between fellow artisans?
            Ash: TRADE! TRADE! TRADE!
            Oak: ...Are you familiar with a warm meal common to menfolk--a mix of oats and water and a dash of something sweet?
            Ash: WARM. SWEET.
            Oak: When we used to complete work in town as naive woodsprites, those grateful for our service would leave a bowl of oatmeal on the windowsill overnight.
            Oak: I believe I speak for both of us when I say we should like to taste it again.
            Ash: AGAIN AGAIN. HOT GRAIN, HOT GRAIN!
            Oak: In return, we will offer you the means to make your...golden drink.
            Ash: GOOD. GOOD!
            Ash: I LOVE PORRIDGE.
            Oak: We eagerly await your return.

                Ash: AND DRINKS! AS LONG AS YOU HAVE COIN.
                Oak: Or a good barter. We cannot resist a binding trade...
                Oak: But a discussion for another time.
                Ash: YOU WILL BE BACK.
            -> Maybe I can return when I'm done with my errands?
                Ash: YOU WORK FOR NO COIN. FOOLISH.
                Oak: Ash means that we hope you are not being exploited. We have, ourselves, left unpaid servitude behind and embrace only payment in full.
                Oak: Though, good Ash, I believe our esteemed guest is an <i>apprentice</i>.
                Ash: YOU ARE LEARNING? SOON YOU WILL BE IN CHARGE?
                Oak: A discussion for another time perhaps, when you are free to partake.

                    Ash: THE TEA IS TOO STRONG.
                    Oak: Much too strong. You may slumber for a hundred years after a single sip.
